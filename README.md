# mebuki
mebuki is a mark down editor, inspired by [itty.bitty](https://github.com/alcor/itty-bitty).

I want to share document written in markdown in the way itty.bitty does.

## Features
- The content is stored in url hash, not in any server. So you can share your document by sending url and only those who knows the url can read your document.
